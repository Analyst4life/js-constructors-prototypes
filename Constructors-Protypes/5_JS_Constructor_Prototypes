This document explains the creation and usage of a `Rectangle` constructor function in JavaScript, including properties, methods, and prototype inheritance.

---

## Rectangle Constructor Function

```javascript
// Define a constructor function named Rectangle.
// Constructor functions are used to create new objects with similar properties and methods.
function Rectangle(name, width, height) {
  // 'this' refers to the object that will be created when we use 'new Rectangle(...)'.
  
  // Assign the 'name' parameter to the 'name' property of the object.
  this.name = name;
  
  // Assign the 'width' parameter to the 'width' property of the object.
  this.width = width;
  
  // Assign the 'height' parameter to the 'height' property of the object.
  this.height = height;
  
  // Define a method 'area' for this object.
  // This method calculates the area of the rectangle using width * height.
  this.area = function () {
    return this.width * this.height;
  };
}

// Create a new Rectangle object called 'rect' with name 'Rect', width 10, and height 10.
// The 'new' keyword creates a new object and sets 'this' inside the constructor to refer to it.
const rect = new Rectangle('Rect', 10, 10);

// Every object in JavaScript inherits from Object.prototype by default.
// That's why 'rect' has access to methods like 'toString()' even though we didn't define them ourselves.
console.log(rect.toString()); // Calls the default 'toString' method from Object.prototype

// Object.getPrototypeOf() returns the prototype (the object that 'rect' inherits from).
// For objects created with a constructor function, this is the constructor's prototype property.
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(rect)); // Shows the prototype of 'rect' (Rectangle.prototype)
